# Resta 1
Resta 1 Puzzle Game (Peg Solitaire) implemented in Visual Basic 3

## Project History
This game was originally developed in 1992 using Visual Basic 1, at the time I was a programmer for the Brazilian Army, developing in COBOL for a text based mini-computer, but I wanted to learn how to program for Windows 3, so I purchased the first Visual Basic book published in Brazil and decided to create this game, basically to learn how to implement a cool Windows feature called "drag-and-drop", a very advanced concept for the time!

Just after this, I also developed another small Memory puzzle game 

This repository has the source code for Visual Basic 3 (I converted as soon as I got my hand on the VB3 disks) but has no changes, is the same version I programmed in VB1.
